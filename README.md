Coinberry is a FINTRAC-Registered Canadian digital asset trading platform, Coinberry.com, that provides users the easiest and safest way to buy and sell cryptocurrency. It was founded in 2017 by Andrei Poliakov. It's latest cybersecurity project, ‘Cybersecurity Augmentation Protection with Blockchain Technology’ has been approved for R&D funding from the National Research Council of Canada Industrial Research Assistance Program (NRC IRAP). The company has not openly disclosed the amount of funding received as it is not publicly listed as yet. 


## Business Activities:

Coinberry, in the process of providing a platform for Canadians to easily buy Crypto, makes money on 'the spread', the difference between the prices the platform sources crypto for, as a high volume customer, and listed prices. As it is still early stage in terms of the Canadian market in adoption, the potential market size is currently unknown, but there is high potential for growth in this industry as more traditional banking/trading consumers become more comfortable with owning and trading cryptocurrencies, and may most likely mirror, if not quickly surpass, the size of the current, traditional stock market. 

At current, it is estimated that 1.2 million people, 3.2% of Canada’s total population, currently own cryptocurrency.

Coinberry stands out due to its regulation-first approach, being FINTRAC-registered, meeting regulatory approval by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). By going through regulatory hoops in order to gain consumer trust, the platform also takes no fees when consumers deposit or fund their trading account, making it appear more affordable for consumers. 

Coinberry uses blockchain technology and is on the Ethereum network, which has its own programming language, Solidity.


## Landscape:

As part of the growing Cryptocurrency exchange industry, Canadian regulators are behind in measuring the impact of this new field. However, from US-based data, CoinGecko, a cryptocurrency data intelligence website, estimates the current market capitalization of cryptocurrencies at US$2.77-trillion; in April, 2020, it was just US$191-billion.

The market is now seeing signs of growth; primarily a retail-led industry, the sector is now seeing large corporations, traditional institutions and investors entering the crypto market. 

It's only competitor in terms of reaching regulatory status is Wealthsimple. 

## Results

Impact is seen from provincial acceptance of cryptocurrecny as payment, as seen by the recent news of Coinberry Pay, where residents of The Town of Innisfil will be able to use BitCoin as a method of payment for property taxes.

As an exxchange platform, quick retail adoption is the best indicator of the Coinberry's success. As the one only other regulated platform to trade crypto in the Canadian marketplace, Coinberry stands to benefit from being an early entrant into the cryptocurency scene. 

In relation to performance, Coinberry, being founded only 3 years ago, is topping the market in terms of trustworthiness and wallet security, which are the formost with regards to investors brand new to crypto.
